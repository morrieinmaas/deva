<h1><center>Studio Deva Divine</h1></center>
<center>Welkom to studio Deva Divine's Website</center> 
<p>
<h2>
<p>
Studio Deva Divine is an alternative studio that specializes in yoga and bellydance.
Since 2014 we've been teaching at our wonderful studio down <br>town Maastricht, in a beautiful old theatre building.
We love to listen to our students and they enjoy spending their time with us, as you can read in some of the 
loving reviews. We often take courses, for example on yogatherapy and alignment,  and we're never done studying,
ensures a safe environment for our students in which they can practice yoga freely.

<p>
In yoga we combine breath and movement. If you are new to yoga, you will notice that there is a lot to pay attention
too. For example: a right posture, focus and attention, muscle tension and breathing. For a beginner it can be quite a lot,
but you will see,
given it some time, it  will come naturally quite fast. The body is great at adapting to yoga. As a beginning yogi you 
will be advised to pay more attention to the proper execution of the postures. The breath will follow
suit. Classes all have a similar 'set up', which you'll get to perceive its structure  usually within 2-3 classes.
Then the real yoga will kick off, you will become part of the flow that arises in class,  with your breathe to guide you.
The studio works with physical cues, meaning the teacher will guide you deeper within the posture, to ensure a good aligment, 
which allows the body to perform optimally.

<h1>how we roll</h1>
<p>
Deva Divine is the only studio that works without a contract. Motivation is something of an intrinsic nature and we
feel that it cannot be forced by some  contract. Because of the voluntariness of it all, it creates a very relaxed
atmosphere, where people are motivated and happy to come back to us. With our no-bulshit system, it's easy to come and
go. But what we see is the tendency that people actually stay with us longer. There is a lot of 
tolerance and mutual interest between our friendly students. And most important: there is always more compassion than competition. <br> 

<br>We sell cards of 5 or 10 visits and work with 'try outs and drop ins'. Check our pricing table for our tarifs
and/ or privacy policy for more information. ( under construction) By subscribing yourself to the newsletter and
 <a href="https://www.facebook.com/StudioDeva.Divine">'like'</a> our facebook page, you become a friend

a free ticket to one of our classes. Currently it works like this: send us an email with your facebook name to verify,
and you will receive a ticket that allows you to make resevations for your free class. If the studio does not get 
a reservation, you will have to pay the regular tarif for your class. When you bring your ticket the next time, you
can join for free, or get reimbursed. </p>
<p>
De studio has a whatsapp poweryoga group. Students use this app to reserve their place for the day they want to come.
It's not mandatory, but when crowded, those with reservations come first to drop ins. The studio's capacity is for around 12 yogi's.

<h1>studio location</h1>
<p>
De studio is located in an old theatre building at Hoogfrankrijk 27 (From Brandweer go up the coblle street, from Kumulus
take the road down. We are in the heart of Maastricht. Halfway the street " Hoogfrankrijk"- next to the car exit of the 
Beyaard- you'll find a big green gate. Use the entrance door on its left. From here you'll acces the parking lot.
You find the studio within the building on your left. Follow the signs ( very easy to find)
Usually the gate opens 15 min in advance and closes 1 min before class. Please make sure to arrive on time! If you know you're going
be late, notify via phone or whatsapp so we can make arrangements for you to enter and not have to miss your class.
 <br>
<br>

<h1>eigen-wijsheid</h1>
<p>
If you have any injury or ailment worth notifying, please let us know, it's important to us.<br>
This way we can give you related options to make sure you have a safe and nice practice. <br>

We count on your own council to be able to work within the boundaries and limitations 
of your body. <br>
Working with breath and body-conciousness lowers the chance of injury dramatically, that 
vinyasa yoga is <br>
said to be one of the safest yoga practices.
